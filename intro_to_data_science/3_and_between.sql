-- When you use the BETWEEN operator in SQL, do the results include the values of your endpoints, or not? Figure out the answer to this important question by writing a query that displays the order date and gloss_qty data for all orders where gloss_qty is between 24 and 29. Then look at your output to see if the BETWEEN operator included the begin and end values or not.
SELECT occurred_at, gloss_qty
 FROM orders
  WHERE gloss_qty BETWEEN 24 AND 29;
